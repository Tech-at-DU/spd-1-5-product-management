# SPD 1.5 Product Management (non-required course)

## Course Description

Product managers are like mini CEOs. They set the plan and guide teammates, and manage changes, stakeholders and risks. The job of a PM is a fascinating challenge: corralling all divisions of the company to make products of unique value. PMs have the added challenge of not being “the boss,” while still having a lot of power, influence, and responsibility.

In this class, students will use case studies, projects, and interviewing to learn key PM skills. Throughout the SPD program, you have already learned many of the skills a PM needs. This course focuses on the more business-side of product management such as, monetization, market research, prioritization, and more.
